# Anxiety Attack Chatbot
Got anxiety? Are you the only one (apart from your therapist) who knows what can help you get through an axiety attack? Here I explain how to build your own chatbot to help you with an axiety attack. Lord knows, I've had my fair share of them and I know things like watching my favourite clip of Pinnochio from Shrek, or figuring out what the trigger is, can be really helpful to get me through.

I built this chatbot using the SnatchBot platform. If you want to build your own sophisticated chatbots, look up approaches here on GitHub.

1. Sign up for an account on [SnatchBot](https://snatchbot.me/)
2. Click on Build
3. Click Add New Interaction
4. Map out the logic path for your chat bot. Here's the logic map of mine below (see image)
5. Type in a question ("Did you sleep enough last night?"), then categorize the response (short answer, numerical value, Yes/No response, etc.)
6. Map each question into a sequence - This will help piece together a conversation sequence for your chatbot to guide a user through
7. Test out the chatbot and make sure all responses match to the right questions asked
6. Keep the link for your chatbot in an accessible area, where you can pop it open and use it whenever you're having a freak out moment.

Also, if your anxiety gets really bad, talk with a therapist (BetterHelp or Talkspace) and get proper help from experts who can help you the best. This was just a side project I built, to lift my spirits and get to the root of what was causing me to freak out!
